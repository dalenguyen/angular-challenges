# Angular Challenges

Here is the collection of the challenges that help to improve Angular practices.

The challenges are organized under `apps/challenges/src/app` folder. For example, you can find the first challenge at `apps/challenges/src/app/duplication-layout-code`. The suggested solution can be found under `solutions.md` in the same folder.

If you have a better solution to a problem, you can help to improve it by creating a PR or a discussion to discuss it further.

This project is open-source, fell free to contribute to this.
